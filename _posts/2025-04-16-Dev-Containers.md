# My Experience with Dev-Containers

I first tried to set up dev containers for the first time about a month ago, and had several troubles encountered along the way

I followed along Brian Lovell's [Devcontainer imstructions ](https://lovellbrian.github.io/2023/10/02/BYODImage.html) for my first setup, which was attempted to be run on my personal machine. For those that know me this machine has seen better days, and this ended up failing for several reasons. Firstly, my computer GPU never ended up working with running any of the fastai GPU-enabled notebooks, and most likely because of a number of errors with my dev container from my hard drive filling up with image files.

After learning the lesson that it takes a lot of space to run a dev container and wsl, I took a step back and attempted this on one of the remote lab computers. This took a while as expected, but ended up running more often than not.
